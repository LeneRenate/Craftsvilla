              come together in endless combinations. In this course, you‚Äôll
              design and craft your own mosaic artwork using small, colorful
              stones arranged on an A4-sized wooden board. The set includes a

              everything needed to create a polished piece. Whether you go for
              geometric precision or free-flowing creativity, the result is a

              Light, fluid, and endlessly expressive ‚Äî watercolor painting
              invites you to play with transparency and flow. This course
              includes a full watercolor set with paper, design template, frame,
              paint, and brushes. You‚Äôll explore how pigments blend and dance
              across the page, creating soft gradients or bold contrasts
              depending on your touch. It‚Äôs an ideal choice if you love color
              and spontaneity. No two watercolor pieces ever look the same -
              each brushstroke tells its own story.
